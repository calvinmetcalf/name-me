name-me
===

Comes up with a random name that is free on NPM.

```bash
npm install -g name-me
name-me # returns a name
```

or pass it something to start with

```bash
name-me ajax # could return ajax-misdate or ajax-huskily or ajax-js
```

If you're fealing lucky, pass it the `-p` option to have to add the name to your package.json.
